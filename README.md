I specialize in full-stack web development using technologies like HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React, Node.js, MongoDB, and more. My goal is to build impactful, responsive, and user-friendly websites and applications. I have experience in both frontend and backend development, as well as designing clean UI/UX.
